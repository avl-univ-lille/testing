## Project 

Under construction

### What is expected?
Implement a simple project. For example, a simple TODO list, or a grocery list using one of:
 - a sql database (e.g., SQLite)
 - a GUI (e.g., vue.js, react.js...)
 - an object serialiser (CVS, JSON,...) - for the purpose of the exercise, try writing your own JSON/CVS serialiser or parser!

Deliverables:
 - a git repository with the code
 - code should be loadable and runnable with a script
 - a **README file** should explain how to install it and run it
 - a **report** written in markdown should be available in the same repository explaining
   - what testing decisions you took
   - what was tested and why
   - did you use some advanced technique? what? where? why?

Restrictions:
 - Use one of the following programming languages: Pharo, Python, C

### When is the deadline? The end of the trimester (at the end of the sixth week)
 
### Some hints for the project
- The project will be graded based on testing, not project features!
- Thus, make few features, but interesting from the testing point of view (with more cases to test)
- write some hand written tests and try to find some libraries that already do advanced testing stuff!
