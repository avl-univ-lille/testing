   - a 2 pages report (max) explaining the main testing design decisions you used.
      - what did you test? why did you test it?
      - what did you not test? why?
      - Have you used mocks? why? where?
      - Have you structured your code in a special way to be able to test it?
comment avez vous fait le code plus testable?
 - you have until the end of the course to do it
 - the exercise will be noted regarding the test design more than the project itself (but please, do not do it wrong!)
